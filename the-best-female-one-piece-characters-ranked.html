During the entire Whole Cake Island arc, Reiju was an ally of the Straw Hat Pirates and soon became a fan favorite. Her internal struggle to reconcile her family’s dark past with her own morality makes her a fascinating character.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6.

Boa Hancock</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=658 data-current-count=958 data-injectable=true>Boa Hancock is a former warlord and the only female to become a Warlord of the seas.
