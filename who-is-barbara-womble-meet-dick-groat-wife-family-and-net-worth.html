<time>18 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Barbara Womble was <strong>Dick Groat’s wife</strong>. Dick and Barbara had a solid relationship and had been married for nearly 35 years. Many people are looking for information about Dick Groat’s wife and family after the professional baseball and basketball player died today, April 28, 2023, at the age of 92.</p><p>Groat died at UMPC Presbyterian Hospital following the consequences of a stroke, according to his family. Pirates Chairman Bob Nutting issued a statement expressing his deep sadness at the loss of such a beloved member of the Pirates family and the Pittsburgh community. Dick went from a strong basketball career at Duke to a short NBA experience before becoming an All-Star and the 1960 National League MVP while playing baseball for his hometown Pittsburgh Pirates.&nbsp;Groat was a well-known player, having won two World Series titles and been an eight-time All-Star shortstop in Major League Baseball. The athlete was a two-sport All-American in both baseball and basketball in college, and he was one of just 13 athletes in American history to play both sports professionally.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dick-groats-wife-and-children></span>Dick Groat’s Wife And Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dick Groat’s wife’s name is Barbara Womble. Barbara was a model that used to live and work in New York. In November of 1955, the sportsman and his wife, Dick Groat, married. The pair adored one other and lived their lives together as husband and wife until Dick Groat’s wife died.</p><p>They had been married for 35 years when Barbara died of lung cancer in 1990. Dick and Barbara’s three daughters were named Tracey, Carol Ann, and Allison.&nbsp;Groat is survived by two more daughters, Tracey Goetz, and Carol Ann Groat, as well as six grandsons and eleven great-grandchildren, as well as Ms. DeStefano, who runs the Champion Lakes club. Groat was at home in the Pittsburgh suburb of Edgewood, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday of last week when former Pirates pitcher and commentator Steve Blass and a television crew knocked on his door. They conducted an impromptu interview while simultaneously alerting Groat about his induction into the Pirates Hall of Fame.&nbsp;According to his daughter Allison DeStefano, Groat had a stroke two days later while going to attend a broadcast of the interview before a Pirates game.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dick-groats-net-worth></span>Dick Groat’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dick Groat had an estimated net worth of 1.7 million dollars at the time of his death, according to several sources.&nbsp;Groat was selected third overall by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the 1952 National Basketball Association draft, but his early success was cut short by a two-year military duty.&nbsp;When Pirates management pressured him to make a professional choice upon his return, the athlete was picked by Major League Baseball and his local organization mostly for financial reasons.</p><p>Groat was elected into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011. Following that, Dick became the first individual to be inducted into both the college baseball and basketball halls of fame. Groat had 352 doubles, 67 triples, 39 home runs, 829 runs scored, and 707 runs batted in across 1,929 games. While playing shortstop, the baseballer converted 1,237 double plays, which ranks 14th in MLB history.&nbsp;Groat was the National League Most Valuable Player and batting champion with the world champion Pittsburgh Pirates in 1960, with a 325 average. In addition, he was named to two All-America teams, twice received the McKelvin Award as the outstanding athlete in the Southern Conference, and became the first basketball player in school history to have his number 10 recognized.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ybmKuakaeubsPOppmlnV2isqbAjJ2gnKNdnL%2BwrdNmrqKelWKzornIpbBmmZ6Zeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-barbara-womble-meet-dick-groat-wife-family-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-barbara-womble-meet-dick-groat-wife-family-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-barbara-womble-meet-dick-groat-wife-family-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-barbara-womble-meet-dick-groat-wife-family-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-barbara-womble-meet-dick-groat-wife-family-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-barbara-womble-meet-dick-groat-wife-family-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alex-oloughlin-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alex-oloughlin-net-worth.html>Alex OLoughlin Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Charity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lgs-optimus-7-samsungs-focus-reviewed-a-tale-of-two-windows-phones.html>The LG Optimus 7 - LG's Optimus 7 &amp;amp; Samsung's Focus Reviewed: A Tale of Two Windows Phones</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lgs-optimus-7-samsungs-focus-reviewed-a-tale-of-two-windows-phones.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
