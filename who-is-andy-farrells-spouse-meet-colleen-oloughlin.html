He then became a full-fledged international at the age of 18, making his debut against New Zealand later in 1993.</p><p>After the 1993–94 Rugby Football League season, in which he scored in Wigan’s Challenge Cup final victory, Andy Farrell traveled with his club to Brisbane and played second row in their victory in the 1994 World Club Challenge against Australian Premiers Brisbane.</p><p>He considers this to be one of his greatest achievements in rugby league. Andy Farrell was selected to play for Great Britain against Australia in all three Ashes Test matches of the Kangaroo Tour in 1994. The following year, he came on as a substitute for Wigan in the 1995 Challenge Cup final against Leeds Rhinos. At the end of the season, he played as a winger for England in the 1995 World Cup final, but Australia won the match and kept the trophy.</p><p>In July 1996, Andy Farrell was named captain of the Wigan Warriors and later that year, aged 21 years and 4 months, became the UK’s youngest-ever captain, leading the Lions tour in 1996 in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Fiji.

After a successful campaign, Andy Farrell had the opportunity to become a full member of the England coaching staff but decided to return to Saracens. However, he soon left the London team.</p><p>On 6 January 2016, it was announced that Farrell would take over as Ireland’s defensive coach after the conclusion of the 2016 Six Nations Championship, because his previous contract with the England team prevented him from working with an international team until April 2016, Farrell joined the Irish province of Munster in January 2016 in a four-month temporary advisory role.</p><p>On 26 November 2018, it was announced that Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt would step down after the 2019 Rugby World Cup, with Farrell taking over as head coach.
