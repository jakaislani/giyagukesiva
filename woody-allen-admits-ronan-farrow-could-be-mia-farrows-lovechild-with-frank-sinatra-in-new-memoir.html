<time>26 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Filmmaker Woody Allen has admitted that his son Ronan Farrow could very well be Mia Farrow's lovechild with Frank Sinatra in his new memoir titled 'Apropos of Nothing'.</p><p>"One day Mia announced she was pregnant. I naturally assumed it was by me and the wolfsbane had finally kicked in; and despite her suggesting [Ronan] was Frank Sinatra's child, I think he's mine, though I'll never really know," Allen wrote in the controversial 400-page book, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released on Monday, March 23</a> by Arcade Publishing.</p><p>"She may have still been sleeping with Frank, as she hinted, and may have had any number of outside affairs, for all I know. As I said, we lived apart," read an excerpt from the book., <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a> reports.</p><p>32-year-old Ronan has long been rumored to be Farrow's lovechild with her ex-husband Sinatra. However, the family very rarely comments on the speculation. At the time Farrow was 21 when she married Sinatra, 50, in 1966. Though the two got divorced two years later, they remained close friends until he died in 1998.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2b59997e-d8e0-4d93-840a-bceb5e1176ba.jpg><p>Allen's memoir begins with him talking about his NYC upbringing and also the love affairs he had with Diane Keaton and a few others with a sense of nostalgia. His memoir does take a darker shade when he recalled his relationship with Farrow and the allegations of him abusing his daughter, Dylan Farrow.&nbsp;</p><p>These allegations have seemingly tarnished and come to define his image in recent years. Allen and Farrow had been together for around a decade. He wrote how she had "managed with great acting skills" to hide her deep personality flaws from him when the couple had met.&nbsp;</p><p>He also shared how he had mistakenly believed that Farrow was just a "fragile, beautiful supermom" whom he dated for 13 years. However, truth be told, she was deeply disturbed and "psychologically and corporally" abused her children into "submissive obedience."</p><p>Allen and Farrow's relationship started in 1980 by which time, Allen had been married two times prior. Farrow had also been married two times prior and had seven children, three of whom were adopted. Allen reveals he missed several red flags because he was so encaptured by Farrow's beauty.&nbsp;</p><p>"She was not demanding, better informed than me, more cultivated, appropriately libidinous, charming to my friends, and, best of all, living directly across Central Park, so there was a major saving in carfare. In retrospect, should I have seen any red flags? I guess, but if you're dating this dream woman, even if you see a red flag you kind of look in the other direction," he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>"Her idea of progress was to run out and marry. But the swiftness of the proposal, such as it was, and her irritable reaction when I wasn't instantly up for it should have clued me in that I was dealing with a more complicated person than just this fragile, beautiful supermom," he added.&nbsp;</p><p>The only thing that kept them together was a convenient arrangement which saw them living in separate apartments.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5%2Bksbp5wKWjnqZdlrGutdOsZKunnpa7brLAq6mor12YvLa4w2aZnmWdnq5ussCrqaivo2K5sMLEnJ%2BipJRixKrAx2adq5meoHq0tc2aq6uZXZ67brrEsGSmnZ2ktrM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwoody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwoody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwoody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./angelina-jolie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie - Children, Age &amp;amp; Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html>Who are Anderson Silvas Kids?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
