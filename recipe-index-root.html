Like all the best game day snacks (looking at you, salsa and guac), they‚Äôre simple, tasty, and really darn fun. The day I took these photos, I planned to eat just one or two jalape√±o poppers straight from the oven, to check that the flavors were right. Before I knew it, I‚Äôd had 3, 4‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs safe to say that the flavors were a-ok. üôÇ Of course, I couldn‚Äôt write a jalape√±o poppers recipe without adding a fresh twist. These jalape√±o poppers are‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These pumpkin muffins are perfect for fall! They‚Äôre soft, super moist, and&nbsp;deliciously spiced‚Äîcinnamon, allspice, and more fill them with seasonal flavor. But best of all, they‚Äôre so easy to make. You can whip them up in less than an hour with a couple of mixing bowls and a whisk. No mixer required here! I love that these pumpkin muffins are sweet, but not too sweet, so that they can pass for breakfast or a healthy snack. Enjoy one (or two) in the morning with a cup of coffee, and then grab another for an afternoon pick-me-up. If you have any‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It‚Äôs pumpkin spice season! Though I‚Äôll never be the kind of person who runs out to get a pumpkin spice latte on the first day of fall, I do enjoy a thick slice of pumpkin bread or a puffy pumpkin muffin at this time of year. When I make these cozy fall treats, I always use homemade pumpkin pie spice instead of buying a spice mix in a jar. Why? Well, just like when I make my own Everything Bagel Seasoning, I can control the ratios of each component. I like my homemade pumpkin pie spice to be heavy on‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I‚Äôm always sad to see summer go, but as I compiled this list of fall recipes over the weekend, I couldn‚Äôt help but look forward to the new season. It‚Äôs a chance for a fresh start, to dive headfirst into a new routine and new activities. Of course, I‚Äôll miss our summer picnics and the nights when the sun didn‚Äôt set till 9, but I‚Äôm also excited for change ‚Äì for hot bowls of soup, weekend baking, and long walks on crisp afternoons. To celebrate the start of the season, I‚Äôm sharing over 60 of my favorite fall recipes below.‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I hope you‚Äôre all excited, because this sweet potato salad recipe is the first of many fall salads that I have coming your way this season! I love salad all year long (Like, who can say no to a tomato salad in the summer?), but fall salads have a special place in my heart. We move away from juicy summer bounty towards sweeter, starchier veggies like sweet potatoes and squash. And after a few months of craving leafless salads filled with tomatoes and corn, I want nothing more than a bowl of fall greens like spinach, arugula, or kale. Together,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Who else loves roasted sweet potatoes?! I don‚Äôt know what it is about fall weather, but when the air gets cool and crisp at this time of year, I start cooking sweet potatoes like crazy. I bake them, I noodle them, I blend them into cozy sauces and toss them into soups. But most often, I roast them. Why? First, roasted sweet potatoes are so darn easy to make! Just chop them up, toss them with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, and bake! The oven does most of the work for you. Second, they‚Äôre delicious. The salt and pepper‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Of all of the homemade salad dressings out there, this lemon tahini dressing might be the one I make most often. It‚Äôs really versatile ‚Äì it tastes just as good with tomatoes and cucumbers in the summer as it does with roasted sweet potatoes, cauliflower, or broccoli in the fall. It consists of a short list of ingredients that I always keep on hand, and it‚Äôs super easy to stir together. No blender or food processor required! Nowadays, most home cooks I know are familiar with tahini, but in case you haven‚Äôt heard of it, it‚Äôs a paste made from‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I told Jack I was working on a homemade tartar sauce recipe, he replied, ‚ÄúOh, are you using cream of tartar?‚Äù I immediately burst out laughing, but I really can‚Äôt blame him for his mistake. I mean, tartar sauce is creamy. It kind of makes sense, right? In reality, the two have nothing to do with one another. Cream of tartar is a powdery baking ingredient that you‚Äôd find in sweets like cookies or meringues. Tartar sauce, on the other hand, is super savory, rich, and tangy. It‚Äôs typically served with seafood, but trust me ‚Äì this delicious condiment‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>During the transition from summer to fall, there‚Äôs nothing I crave more than this tomato basil soup recipe. Apples and squash are starting to pop up at the farmers market, but you can still find ruby red tomatoes and bunches of basil mixed in among them. I‚Äôll be eating these summer veggies for as long as they‚Äôre at the market, even as the temperature starts dropping and I find myself hungry for warming bowls of soup instead of salads. So at this time of year, I start making this tomato basil soup. I roast a market haul of fresh tomatoes‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I‚Äôve gotten&nbsp;so&nbsp;many requests for a gluten free banana bread recipe over the years, and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to share this one with you! Tasting this gluten free banana bread, you‚Äôd never guess that it wasn‚Äôt made with wheat flour. It‚Äôs moist, tender, and filled with spiced banana flavor. In fact, if I did a side-by-side comparison with my regular Healthy Banana Bread, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to choose a favorite! We‚Äôre getting some sunshine in Chicago today, but for the last week, it‚Äôs been cool and rainy.

Jack and I have made regular homemade pizza for years, but this spring, this cast iron pizza recipe took our pizza game to a whole new level. It‚Äôs the closest you‚Äôll ever come to making restaurant-style pizza without a fancy oven or pizza stone. Thanks to the hot skillet, the crust becomes crisp and browned on the outside, while the thick edges stay nice and chewy in the middle.
