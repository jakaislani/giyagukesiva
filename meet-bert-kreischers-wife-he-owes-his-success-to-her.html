<time>01 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Bert Kreischer is a stand-up comedian, podcaster, and reality TV host. He has come a long way since earning Rolling Stone’s 1997 “Number One Partier in the Nation” tag and is now regarded as one of the best-paid stand-up comics in the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, Pollstar listed Bert as #4 in the “Top 10 Highest Grossing Tours” because his shows are often sold out. The talented comic is currently on his 2023 Tops Off World Tour. Given his popularity, it is hard not to think about who Bert is when he is off the stage.</p><p>Bert Kreischer’s wife is a big part of that off-stage life, and according to him, she also plays a significant role in his continued success. So who is this woman? Keep reading to meet her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/berttt.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Bert_Kreischers_Wife></span>Who Is Bert Kreischer’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bert Kreischer is currently married to a woman named LeAnn Kreischer. LeeAnn is the only child of her parents. Her father was a mechanic, while her mom reportedly had a job sewing men’s suits in a local factory.&nbsp;</p><p>After her parents got divorced, LeeAnn and her mom migrated to Atlanta. Her mom became the “highest-paid model for about nine years.” She claims their relationship is only as good as it is because they are both rednecks.&nbsp;</p><p>LeAnn met Bert as she was approaching 30 years of age. At the time, she was a writer and did not think what they had would go anywhere.&nbsp;When she first met the comedian, her father lived in the convenience store he owned in their town. Bert is fond of joking about how he and LeeAnn’s father get along.</p><p>The gorgeous woman changed her mind about Bert after they had a good time together for the first time, and she realized she was genuinely interested in him.&nbsp;They started dating shortly after that, then tied the knot in December 2003. They currently live in Los Angeles, California, with their two daughters.&nbsp;</p><p>LeAnn is unique to Bert for many reasons. For starters, she has the honor of being the subject of most of his comedic routines.&nbsp;She has made multiple appearances on his podcast, “Bercast.” She also <a href=#>hosts</a> a podcast called “Wife of the Party” from her husband’s “man cave” in their house.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bert_Kreischers_Wife_Is_His_Backbone></span>Bert Kreischer’s Wife Is His Backbone&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Those close to Bert Kreischer know that the funnyman couldn’t do anything without his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/berrt-fotor-20230816154057.jpg><p>When he appeared on the “Are You Garbage?” podcast in March 2023, Bert credited LeeAnn for helping him become such a huge success.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “I really could not have done any of this without her. I picked the right chick.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bert is entirely correct. Not only does he have good synergy with his wife, but she also has a sense of humor that perfectly complements him.&nbsp;This means that she is a good sport when it comes to his comedy. Bert makes jokes that sometimes could be seen as offensive by other wives, but his wife takes it all in stride and never seems to mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Bert is also the perfect man for her as he supports her every endeavor and showers her with love and attention at every juncture.&nbsp;The talented showman is not afraid to talk about how much he loves LeeAnn. On an episode of his podcast, he <a href=#>said</a>, “I love her way more than she loves me. I get a kick out of that woman.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bert_Kreischers_Wife_Keeps_Him_Grounded></span>Bert Kreischer’s Wife Keeps Him Grounded&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no doubt that Bert and his wife perfectly complement each other. However, the comedian has confessed that she is the more practical one in the past.&nbsp;In a 2014 interview, Bert talked about how LeAnn helped him avoid what would have been a costly career mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>It was around when Bert agreed to do the SkyJump at the Stratosphere in Las Vegas for his Travel Channel series “Bert the Conqueror.”&nbsp;The event is the highest commercial decelerator descent in the world, so it is one of the premier attractions for adrenaline junkies.</p><p>However, the night before the jump, Bert got cold feet and called LeeAnn, confessing that he was planning to abandon the project.&nbsp;She reassured him he needed to be more mature by letting his team know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bbbert.jpg><p>He took her advice, and the show producer agreed with his decision. He told Bert that he at least needed to reach the edge before making his decision.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Bert Kreischer</a> took that advice, too. Ultimately, he conquered his fear and jumped anyway. Aside from helping him avoid mistakes, LeAnn handles the family’s finances.&nbsp;</p><p>She was the one who set things up where they lived on his tour earnings while saving all of his TV money. A sound decision that continues to pay them even today.&nbsp;Clearly, these two are a match made in heaven, and fans hope they remain in love.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aZnqqkYrizscismqGdoqh6uLXFnmShnV2kxKa%2FjKGgrGWjqrCksdKsZK2nXZ2ys3s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeet-bert-kreischers-wife-he-owes-his-success-to-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmeet-bert-kreischers-wife-he-owes-his-success-to-her.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmeet-bert-kreischers-wife-he-owes-his-success-to-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmeet-bert-kreischers-wife-he-owes-his-success-to-her.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeet-bert-kreischers-wife-he-owes-his-success-to-her.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeet-bert-kreischers-wife-he-owes-his-success-to-her.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./osei-sika.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./osei-sika.html>Weeks After She Got Married, Osei Sika Returns to Social Media With Stunning Photo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-good-is-dillon-danis-jiu-jitsu-what-is-dillon-danis-jiu-jitsu-record.html>How good is Dillon Danis jiu-jitsu?
