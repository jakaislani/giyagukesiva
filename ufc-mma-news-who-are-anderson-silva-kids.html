His daughters are named Kaory Silva and Kauana Silva. The two elder sons of Anderson have been spotted a lot with the Spider while he is fighting inside the Octagon.</p><p>Both of Anderson Silva son’s train every day at Silva’s gym in Los Angeles. However, for now, none of them have shown a keen interest in taking up professional fighting.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>The children of Anderson Silva- upcoming legends?</h2><h3 class=jsx-8c85ea4b4bcf4dfc><strong>Kalyl Silva</strong></h3><p>21-year-old Kalyl Silva shares his father’s fighting style and extraordinary skills. His way of fighting and flashy moves resemble all what the Spider delivers inside the octagon. However, there is no indication of how serious he is about fighting, but he definitely shows the genetic predisposition to be a force inside the cage.</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/anderson-silva-family-become-united-states-citizens.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>When speaking about his father’s legacy this is what the 21-year-old <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>said</a>, “It’s something I don’t see every day.</p><p>“Before, I used to get really anxious, but I’m used to it now. He’s very prepared and I’m sure he’ll do great in the Octagon and do his job. It’s just crazy. I keep thinking as I lay down on the bed before I sleep about all of this, and I just can’t find the words to describe it. We used to live in a one-bedroom house, he used to work at a restaurant, and now here we are. It’s just crazy.</p><p>“He still has a lot of it inside him. Before, I wanted him to quit, but this is all part of him. My dad’s been doing this since he was 15 years old, his whole life is in it. I don’t want him to stop doing what he loves the most.”</p><h3 class=jsx-8c85ea4b4bcf4dfc>Gabriel Silva</h3><p>22-year-old Gabriel Silva is no less than his younger brother. According to the legend, his eldest son is someone who knows most about fighting. The world is aware of his fine techniques when it comes to kickboxing and has marked numerous victories to his name in the sport.</p><p>When <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>speaking</a> about his father, the elder Silva son became emotional. “I like to go along with him to his fights because I grew up watching him become the fighter he is now. I pay a lot of attention to details and try to help him at what he can improve on as we’re always talking. It’s very satisfying, especially for us, because we watched his development very closely. He’s still humble and true to his ideas. We always learn something new talking to him.</p><p>“I was always against the idea of him retiring. He must keep training and getting in the Octagon while he has the energy and the health to do so,” he said. “If that’s what’s keeping him happy, I’ll always be there supporting him.”</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GS-3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The other Silva kids have kept a low profile till now and have kept away from the limelight. In spite of all, it is quite evident that The Spider is all backed up by his family. A lot of the credit for his achievements goes to all the support that comes from his kids and wife.</p><p>The Spider’s reign in the octagon will soon come to a halt. However, with all the support from his family, the fighter looks all happy to welcome the next phase of his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SfmmalnZZ6r7HWrGSwoJ9irrOxjJqlnZ2iqLyvedKio6%2BZXaC2pb%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fufc-mma-news-who-are-anderson-silva-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./woody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./woody-allen-admits-ronan-farrow-could-be-mia-farrows-lovechild-with-frank-sinatra-in-new-memoir.html>Woody Allen admits Ronan Farrow could be Mia Farrow's lovechild with Frank Sinatra in controversial</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rhoc-shannon-beador-net-worth.html>RHOC: Shannon Beador Net Worth - Are They Still Alive?
