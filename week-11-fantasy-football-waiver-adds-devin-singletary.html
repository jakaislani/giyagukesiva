<time>14 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div>Commercial Content 21+<p>Clichés become cliché for a reason: They have a basis in truth.</p><p>For example, a needle can look quite similar to a stalk of hay. So if a needle is hidden in a stack of hay …</p><p>Sure, things that look similar can be hard to distinguish, but that doesn’t mean impossible.</p><p>And if you know what differences you’re looking for, if you can find shortcuts to identifying those differences, then it can make the process much less maddening.</p><p>As the Madman’s constant search for quality fantasy running back options proceeds, there is a bright light we’re shining onto waiver-wire options in hopes of finding that reflective needle that represents a quality RB.</p><p>When we shine this light onto our waiver wire, what reflects back is a strand of Devin Singletary and a straw of Ty Chandler among a stack of useless RB hay.</p><p>Over the course of Singletary’s five seasons — the first four with the Bills — he always has had to fight for carries.</p><p>In Buffalo, it was, at various times, Zach Moss, James Cook, Matt Breida or Frank Gore, not to mention QB Josh Allen.</p><p>This season, he has taken a backseat to Dameon Pierce. But Pierce has been out the past two games with an ankle injury.</p><p>That opened the door for Singletary, who took advantage in Week 10 vs. the Bengals — tallying career highs in carries (30) and rushing yards (150), and racking up 23.1 points in PPR.</p><p>Pierce has been aggressively meh this season, after a promising rookie year in 2022. His lackluster production and now injury have opened the door for Singletary.</p><p>Even when Pierce returns, it is hard to imagine the Texans go back to Pierce as the primary runner, since that could objectively be considered a downgrade at this point — Singletary is averaging nearly a full yard better per carry (3.9-3.0).</p><p>When you find a glimmer of success in a haystack of mediocrity, why would anyone toss that needle back into the fray. You nurture that needle, snuggle up with it, give it more carries.</p><p>At least, that is what makes sense, and we think that is what the Texans will do. And that makes Singletary a nice waiver-wire add if he is still available in your league.</p><p>There are plenty of leagues, however, where Singletary is already rostered.</p><p>Don’t fret, just look north to Minnesota. Alexander “Admiral Average” Mattison was sidelined this past week with a possible concussion.</p><p>With the equally unimpressive Cam Akers out for the season with an Achilles injury, the Vikings turned to Chandler.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/NYPICHPDPICT000072228586.jpg><p>The second-year RB didn’t do much to separate himself — 15-for-45 and a score — but he could get another chance if Mattison can’t go this week.</p><p>And it shouldn’t take much to outperform the Admiral, and at worst should become part of a committee in a high-powered offense.</p><p>Both offer a glimmer of hope for the future, which is often hard to find in a waiver-wire stack of useless fantasy RBs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>On the up & up</h2><p><strong>Joshua Dobbs QB, Vikings</strong></p><p>Jinx check: We’ve been down on him most of the season, and he keeps proving the Madman wrong. You win, we’re in. Now, don’t decide to suddenly become the dud we said you were earlier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/NYPICHPDPICT000072229448.jpg><p><strong>Khalil Herbert, RB, Bears</strong></p><p>Possibly cut weeks ago and forgotten. We would be surprised if he doesn’t return from an ankle injury this week. Think he will assume lead role in Bears backfield down the stretch.</p><p><strong>Brandin Cooks, WR, Cowboys</strong></p><p>Hello, there. He finally had his Cowboys breakout game — 9-for-173 and a score. We expect him to become a reliable second WR option behind CeeDee Lamb and have some Flex appeal each week.</p><p><strong>Jayden Reed, WR, Packers</strong></p><p>With Romeo Doubs just OK and Christian Watson being … what? Where is he? Why does he stink now? Did he retire? Reed looks like the best and most explosive WR option for Packers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betting on the NFL?</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Down, boys</h2><p><strong>Zack Moss, RB, Colts</strong></p><p>It was nice while it lasted, but Jonathan Taylor is fully back. Moss got one carry Sunday. Only reason to keep him on your roster is as a Taylor handcuff.</p><p><strong>DJ Moore, WR, Bears</strong></p><p>Entered this week with a per-game average that ranked 12th among WRs. But if you remove his one, 49-point explosion in Week 5, he has averaged the equivalent of WR28 across the other nine games.</p><p><strong>Adam Thielen, WR, Panthers</strong></p><p>Jinx check: Had him on the bench for some huge weeks early in the season before we bought in. We bought in, then he had a run of ho-hum weeks. Now we’re benching him again. Let’s see what happens.</p><p><strong>Calvin Ridley, WR, Jaguars</strong></p><p>Jinx check: We keep waiting for him to pop, but Ridley has more games in single digits (five) than not (four), and now Zay Jones is nearing a return. We’re no longer afraid to cut Ridley.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmamxfqL2wvtOsZrCdlaB6cn2Mn5inrJGoxm6yzqirm5mcoXq4rcivnKtlkZmxtHnDnq2ipl2otq%2Bzy56rmqqpZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fweek-11-fantasy-football-waiver-adds-devin-singletary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fweek-11-fantasy-football-waiver-adds-devin-singletary.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fweek-11-fantasy-football-waiver-adds-devin-singletary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fweek-11-fantasy-football-waiver-adds-devin-singletary.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fweek-11-fantasy-football-waiver-adds-devin-singletary.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fweek-11-fantasy-football-waiver-adds-devin-singletary.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amaan-iqbal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amaan-iqbal.html>Amaan Iqbal- Wiki, Age, Ethnicity, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shady-side-bhad-bhabie.html>The Shady Side Of Bhad Bhabie</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shady-side-bhad-bhabie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
