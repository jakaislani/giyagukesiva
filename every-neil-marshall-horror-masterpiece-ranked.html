He’s also a progressive filmmaker who has helped change the role of women in horror. Often, his female leads are integral to his greatest movies. In 2012, Marshall jumped from film to TV, directing key episodes of some of the highest profile series around, including Black Sails, Westworld, and Lost in Space.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>He’s perhaps most famous for his Emmy-nominated directing on Game of Thrones (Blackwater? Get Marshall in). But the tales of the horror directors who fly close to Hollywood don’t always end well. For Marshall, it ended when Lionsgate lured him to direct their high-profile hot potato of a Hellboy reboot.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>That ill-fated Hellboy adaptation was terrible news for the Right Hand of Doom and Hollywood, but it was great news for fans of his early horrors. He hoped it would bring him back to directing features after a seven-year break, but nobody guessed how that movie would turn out.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Now Marshall has returned to his independent roots as a DIY director, churning out lean films while broadening his genres — he along with production partner and frequent leading lady Charlotte Kirk has the gangster movie Duchess set for 2023. On the horror side, we’re seeing the return of Marshall motifs that, for horror fans, feel like coming home. There are majors with the surname Sinclair and distorted, corrupted humans everywhere along with big explosions, of course.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>So, with another Marshall wonder on its way, here’s our ranking of his impressive collection of horror movies. Werewolves, genetic experiments, and Hollywood expectations — which are the worst?</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>8. </strong><strong>Hellboy </strong><strong>(2019)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>An inevitable place to start — you knew it was heading your way like a giant red stone fist. The odds were stacked against Hellboy from the start, but it was surprising how devastatingly this movie stalled the Hellboy franchise. It was a rough period for Marshall, and he’s spoken of his error taking on a project where the script wasn’t in good shape.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Labeled as the reboot nobody wanted, Hellboy masked some impressive horror sequences, particularly the disturbing and mostly irrelevant Baba Yaga scenes. The silver lining is that it turned Marshall back to independent filmmaking.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>7. </strong><strong>The Reckoning </strong><strong>(2021)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>A change of pace as Marshall and Charlotte Kirk headed to the 17th century for an adventure horror that shone a light on the trials and real-life horror women were subjected to during the Witch Trials. It’s the Witch’s Tale, where Kirk is put through hell to demonstrate the horrific misogyny and abuse of the time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Kirk, who puts in a dedicated and demanding physical performance as Grace Haverstock, the widow accused of being a witch, also co-wrote the script — her first with Marshall. The Reckoning notably reunited the director with actor Sean Pertwee after they collaborated on Dog Soldiers.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>6. </strong><strong>Doomsday </strong><strong>(2008)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>A mix of Escape to New York and Mad Max, but with a distinctly British vibe, Doomsday stars Rhona Mitra as the Major who is dispatched to a walled and quarantined Scotland to find a cure to the deadly virus that has escaped to London.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>It earned plaudits for continuing Marshall’s creation of strong female leads, but the set-up is a bit rushed, and it’s more confusing than Marshall’s previous two movies. But iff you’re after a rip-roaring, slightly out-of-control sci-fi horror, this has the gore for you.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>5. </strong><strong>The Lair </strong><strong>(2022)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Charlotte_Kirk_Lair_2022.jpg><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>Marshall’s Lair is mostly a brilliant return to his early days. It’s another collaboration with Charlotte Kirk, who naturally takes the lead role as Major Sinclair. The script veers wildly, and the underground sequences feel a little too Resident Evil, lacking some of the imagination we expect from a director with a groundbreaking subterranean horror on his resume. But Marshall is on great form above ground, obviously enjoying the desert filming and blowing things up.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Its action, a kind of Doom in the desert, makes for good and gory fun. It’s great to have Marshall back with a macho movie, led by a woman, that combines smarts and violence.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>4. </strong><strong>Centurion </strong><strong>(2010)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Marshall takes full advantage of the scenery and doesn’t skimp on the brutal fight scenes, which is where most of the horror lies. The Ninth Legion was said to have marched into Scotland with 3,000 men and never returned. Here they make up what’s arguably Marshall’s greatest cast, even if they brought him one of his worst box office performances.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Romans were the turn of the decade’s asteroids. A year after this came out, Channing Tatum’s The Eagle trod similar ground and did a bit better at the box office. A shame as the mystery of the missing Ninth Legion is an intriguing premise, and there’s room for both.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>3. </strong><strong>Tales of Halloween </strong><strong>(2015)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>Tales of Halloween was a fine attempt to reawaken the great horror anthology-style movies. Marshall closes the film with the segment Bad Seed — a well-received snippet. It’s a fantastic diversion in Marshall’s resume, featuring horrific carnivorous pumpkins. Less a warning about genetic modification of vegetables than a Halloween treat.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>2. </strong><strong>Dog Soldiers </strong><strong>(2002)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>Do Soldiers was the movie that rightly made Marshall’s name. The concept is brilliantly simple — put some soldiers in the woods and surround them with werewolves. The film attracted praise for its special effects, horror, and comedy — no mean feat for a low-budget horror debut.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>It was well worth the six years it took to refine the script and land financing. Hopes remain high that the dogs will one day run the show again.</p><h2 id=h-1-the-descent-2005 data-injectable=false><strong>1. </strong><strong>The Descent </strong><strong>(2005)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>The female cast made an immediate impression in this atmospheric horror. It’s hard to believe that Marshall initially resisted, fearing he’d be typecast as a horror director if he made another film in the same genre after the widely praised Dog Soldiers. The Descent shows off his full range of talents, wringing scares, and emotion in one place you don’t want to find yourself being pursued by humanoid crawlers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>The Descent is a superbly claustrophobic horror that jangles the nerves and achieves a superb balance of tension and shocks. Its twist on The Final Girl motif is the one reason it’s the only Marshall movie to score a sequel so far.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>Here’s hoping that Neil Marshall gives us more horror wonders from the never-ending stock of his rich imagination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonK%2Bdoq56r7HIpWSmmaKotaK4y2afqKqipL9uucCsq56qoJ6ypLGMq5ino5WZfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-neil-marshall-horror-masterpiece-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fevery-neil-marshall-horror-masterpiece-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fevery-neil-marshall-horror-masterpiece-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fevery-neil-marshall-horror-masterpiece-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-neil-marshall-horror-masterpiece-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-neil-marshall-horror-masterpiece-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kathryn-prescott.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kathryn-prescott.html>Kathryn Prescott Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./catherine-tate.html>Catherine Tate</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./catherine-tate.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
